# websitedesignsystem
<p>
  This website design system originally was intended for personal consumption, hence, its 
  scanty content.
</p>
<p>
  Although the content dearth may present it in the form of a style guide or a pattern library, 
  that is by no means the aim. However, the resource is progressive, and its contents will be 
  elaborated from time to time as I create more designs. 
</p>
<p>
  The immediate aim of the design system is not to be an enterprise-type design system, even though 
  that is a possibility in the future. However, individual / personal consumers, as well as small 
  businesses may find it insightful and useful.
